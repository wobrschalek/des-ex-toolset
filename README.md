# DesEx Toolset
This toolset is intended to provide design space exploration capabilities for the spacecraft domain when using MBSE. 
Its use if further detailed in its companion paper, available here: https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-improving-the-design-space-exploration-process-using-gene
## MBSE Environment
The toolset is designed for SysML and to be used with Cameo Systems Modeller. MATLAB is nessecary for storing 
and visualising design space data and STK provides orbital co-simulation.
## Components
The toolset contains a template project, including a profile of stereotypes for parameter variability modelling, workflow 
diagrams for executing design space explorations and MATLAB based interface for co-simulation in STK.
